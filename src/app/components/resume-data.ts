  about:
    "Cybersecurity analyst with two years of remote SOC, incident response, and IT operations supporting North American enterprise clients. I investigate 100+ alerts a week in Elastic SIEM and Microsoft 365 Defender, hunt threats, and drive containment — including tactical support during an active Akira ransomware engagement, isolating compromised domain controllers and ESXi hosts before large-scale encryption. A foundation in Python and Pandas lets me automate log analysis for fast, high-volume triage, and I keep Canadian client environments running through Microsoft 365 tenant administration, firewall and VPN configuration, and endpoint provisioning. I'm finishing a B.S. in Remote Sensing & GIS and studying for CompTIA Security+.",
