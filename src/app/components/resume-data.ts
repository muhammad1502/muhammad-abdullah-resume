  about: [
    "I'm a cybersecurity analyst at Ninpo Inc., working remotely as a SOC analyst for North American enterprise clients. For the past **two years** I've triaged alerts, hunted threats and helped contain incidents, including an **active Akira ransomware attack**, where I helped isolate compromised domain controllers and ESXi hosts before large-scale encryption.",
    "Each week I investigate **100+ alerts** in Elastic SIEM and Microsoft 365 Defender, and I use Python and Pandas to automate log analysis so triage stays fast. I also keep Canadian client environments running: Microsoft 365 tenant administration, firewall and VPN configuration, and endpoint provisioning.",
    'I also design and build websites. I use AI coding tools for the build and put my own time into layout, accessibility and user experience. This site is one example.',
    "I'm finishing a B.S. in Remote Sensing & GIS and studying for CompTIA Security+.",
